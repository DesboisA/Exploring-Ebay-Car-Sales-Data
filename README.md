# Exploring-Ebay-Car-Sales-Data

## Description

In this project, the [data set of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen](https://data.world/data-society/used-cars-data), a classifieds section of the German eBay website was used to analyze the included used car listings. 

Data cleaning were performed and few modifications were made from the original dataset:

- Sampled down to 50,000 data points to ensure the code runs quickly
- Modified to bring it closer to a real scraped dataset

In this analysis, the following tasks performed:

- Data cleaning and exploration
- Odometer & Registration yearinvestigation
- Exploring Price by Brand
- Correlation between price and mileage (odometer_km)?
- Further data cleaning
- Most common brand/model combinations
- How much cheaper are cars with damage than their non-damaged counterparts?
